Description: The  `distFit` R package offers threefold functionality to investigate goodness-of-fit with normal and Weibull distributions. 
    First, calculates the shape and scale parameters of the theoretical Weibull distribution, 
    second, compares the data set to plots of both distributions, 
    and third, evaluates the data set's goodness-of-fit with both distributions.
